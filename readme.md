The repository is intended just to follow the [The Node.js Master Class](https://www.skillshare.com/en/classes/The-Node-js-Master-Class-No-Frameworks-No-NPM-No-Dependencies/187976462/projects) following Skillshare class.
Thanks to that, you can build 3 pieces of software from scratch in plain ES5 Javascript:
- A RESTful API
- A web app GUI
- A terminal based CLI (Command-line program)
And you’re going to do all of this with nothing but Node.js's standard API. Just a text editor, a terminal, and Node.js. Nobody else’s code, nobody else’s frameworks, nobody else’s libraries. We won’t be using NPM at all, just Node. Your apps won’t even have a package.json file, because we don’t need any dependency management.
